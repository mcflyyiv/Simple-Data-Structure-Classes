# Simple Data Structure Classes

## Descrition

This project is based off of an assignment given in my 350 level Software Design course. The current state specifically is the result of two assignments:
 
  ### Assingment 1: Build an Array class 
  
    **Given:** Array.h 
    
    Build a functioning array class that fit the structure and worked with all of the methods defined in the Array.h file given. We also had
    to learn how to build the assingments makefile using a system called MPC. 
  
    **Design Points:**
  
  ### Assignment 2: Build Stack, Queue, and Fixed_Array classes implemented with C++ Templates
  
    Given: Stack.h Fixed_Array.h 
    
    The second assingnment was to build Stack, Queue, and Fixed Array's ( which cannot be resized ) that will also work for any datatype using Template 
    programming. We were given the Stack.h and Fixed_Array.h files but allowed to structure the Queue.h any way we felt.
    
    **Design Points:
